# Bonzzu React Native Challenge using Typescript

Dev: GermÃ¡n GÃ³mez ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

This project was created in a live coding session. I was requested to complete a mockup in a ~40 minute time frame. 

1. Create the balance, show it and create a button that shows/hides the balance.
2. Create the Rewards Box (image was not provided).
3. Show a list of 3 CryptoCurrencies (mock a list with the data provided in the mockup).

This was the mockup I had to code:

This was my finalized UI for the live coding session: 

branch: *live-coding-session*

I took the time to get rid of all warnings in the project like so:

branch: *enhance-typescript*

![no-warnings](https://github.com/gg-ballin/challenge-bonzzu/assets/28662117/07cd59c8-aeb3-4337-9ff1-a7d006e7d69e)

Also, I decided to enhance a little bit the UI:

branch: *enhance-UI*/*main*
